,"The real reason I could not write any sooner was because I hurt my right hand. I was helping my boss pile up some scrap iron he had around his big farm when an old iron plow fell across the back of my ooh! knuckles?? (how do you spell it?) metacarpals and carpals. The Boss thought it was broken but I said it didn't hurt much (not much oh yes!) You know how it is when a person is around when you get hurt. Well, we finished in about 1 1/2 hrs. I got off from work so I had my hand plastered and bandaged for a couple of days. I took it off on 14th ""yesterday"", and boy was it swollen up.",Beet-farms;Labor-conditions;[insert proper term for landowner/supervisor/'boss']

,We had snow last night. Imagine! 3 inches of snow in the middle of May. And icicles and ice... Gosh! I was surprised enough when we had snow twice in April. And talk about mud. Oh! It's just mud anyway. Even on the No. 5 Alberta Highway it's just about 6 inches mud. Then when you get in the side roads its a foot thick. (I mean it's very muddy). Cars cannot run on the roads when it rains.,Living-conditions
,"How's B.C.? To-day as I was listening to CBC about 8.30 to 9 P.M.

Something to that effect anyway. It sure reminded me of Surrey. Gee! I was hoping that he would go on but he started on some talk about the Blind being trained for defense work such as serving on Canteen trucks etc. I sure miss the funnies!

I sent a letter to Mr. Matheson and Miss Nordberg, but I didn't hear from them since. Gosh! I'm just about going to be disappointed. I'll wait a few more days to get an answer, and if I don't, then I really will be disappointed. I've been waiting since May 1st.",Mail
,"I spent my birthday in Alberta (at home). It was the 11th day of May. I never dreamt that I would be spending or rather have my birthday celebration in Alberta, of all places. Oh! the weather was awful. The road muddy. Then when it cleared a bit, my brother and his friend and I decided to go to Lethbridge 25-30 miles away, but oh! darn the rain, no car could go because of the mud, so I stayed home and read a book, I mean some Saturday Evening Posts.",Recreation;Living-conditions

,Dear Gang-,
,"I guess it's useless to start apologizing and making excuses for not writing these past centuries. I must have had a touch of laziness again. Well, may I begin to tell you all or nearly all that happened since I last wrote? O.K.? Swell.",Writing
,"To begin with the last time I wrote was in March wasn't it? or was it before that. About that time we were all practising to put on a concert or ""Club Review"" as we called it, on the end of March. ",Recreation;Education
,"You know, something like the big concert we had in Q.E.? only it wasn't half so good.",Homesickness;Recreation
,"The surprising part of it was that they never had such a concert like this before in Magrath. We had a packed house both times. (We put it on 2 nights.) It was the greatest success Magrath has ever put on. School inspectors and other school teachers etc. commented on it very highly. They has such things as dancing displays, plays (short) tumbling (I gave them a sample of Q.E. tumbling) with 3 other boys; the school band (5 piece)",Living-conditions;Recreation;Education
,songs by the glee club and a few other items. There was a dance after each performance (I mean at the end of each night.). That concert was the talk of the town for a month.,Recreation
,We had pictures taken etc. I got hold of me print of myself on top of a pyramid and had it autographed by the other fellows I'll get hold of another and send it over. We had fun doing it too.,Photographs
,"All the time in between, we played badminton.",Recreation
,"A week after the concert we had Easter exams. Pretty fair tests. Only some dopey girls (excuse me) cheated and got caught. Boy, was there a row over it.",Education
,Easter holidays came and I went to herd sheep about 60-70 miles from here. My boss has a couple of thousand head of sheep there. There were 3 of us boys and 2 men working there. It was lambing season so we were very busy. My boss couldn't get anybody to take my place so I had to stay away from school all May. I really was a shepherd of the hills then. I had to watch and take care of 1500 head of ewes and little lambs. The last week I was there I had to take the herd a few miles away from the other sheep so that they do not mix. I had to stay all by myself for a week.,Labour-conditions;[insert proper term for landowner/supervisor/'boss']
,"I had to cook by myself. I never saw a human being for 4 days. wow! what misery! Since it was better to leave the sheep outside of the corral, I had to watch them longer. The darn sheep head for all over the places as soon as it gets light and I do not stop till dark. I watched them all day and bring them back at night. I watch them till about 9-9:30 P.M. In the morning I have to get up between 4.30 A.M. and 5 A.M., catch a bite to eat and put some oranges etc. in my pocket for a mid-morning bite and off I go. I'll tell you now that I'll never do that again. I went there expecting to be home in 1 week but I had to stay 22 days! My boss sure was glad cause I stayed for him. If it was some grumpy old guy I might have left but he's been very good to us so I stayed for him. While I was there I found lots of pieces of petrified wood. If you'd like to see some I'll send some over. Let me know eh? I turned a combination of geologist and a herder. I found a number of pieces of petrified wood. Big and small; from 1 oz. to 15 lbs.",Labour-conditions;[insert proper term for landowner/supervisor/'boss']
,So much for that. When I came home I found that the beets were awaiting me. Well for,Beet-farms

,"I went back to school just before this and found out that I was recommended in all subjects. They said that I cannot receive my Senior Matric this year 'cause the credits are rather on the low side. That is, they took away so much that I'll have to go back another year. Same with Tom Tsukishima. I'm thinking of going back next year.",Education
,"Say, thanks for sending me the Q.E. Vue Joan, it sure was swell. To tell you the utmost truth I just about felt like crying when I read about the graduation and to think that I would have been there too. Gosh! I sure had a swell time while I attended good old, I mean new Q.E. Gosh! but I've finally lost hope of getting that Q.E. pin which I was supposed to have won. I wrote to ""Stinky"" but no response. I guess he decided that it was just a waste to send it to me eh?",Homesickness;Education
,What are you all doing nowadays? Having fun? I hope so.,
,"Nearly everyday except Sundays and 1st of July, I've been working out on the prairies. Wow! is it ever hot! We hayed",Labour-conditions;Living-conditions
,for a week in the blazing heat. It was 114° F at 6 P.M. so you can guess how hot it was at 1 or 2 P.M. Sweat just pours down in streams and water just flows nearly continuously down the hatch. I guess we drink a gallon or two of water each day. I've been mowing and raking hay these last few days and we start to hay again on Thursday.,
,On the 24th of July a holiday for Magrath (It's birthday) us Evacuees play ball against the Local boys. We have formed a team and have practised every Sunday for about a month. We have fun tho'. Last Sunday after ball practise we had a wiener roast beside a canal and enjoyed it very much.

,Dear Joan;,
,"I do not know how to thank you for that swell pin. You do not know how I felt when I touched it and looked at for a long time. That pin alone brought back the memories that I have cherished for so long. It reminded me of Q.H.S. and of the students that were in it and are in it now. It brought me back to the time I shook hands with you on that last day at school. Gosh, but I wish I could live those years over again. I feel like a soldier away on a foreign shore fighting in battles, and thinking the peaceful hours spent before the tragic occurance. Thank you an awful lot Joan, for the pin. I won't forget it.",Homesickness;Education;Forced-dispersal;WWII;Belonging

,Dear Joan -,
,To-day is the 3rd of January. oh yes! May I wish you a Happy New Year? Did you have a White Xmas? I had a pretty nice Xmas–and New Years too.,

,"""The 7th of dec. was on a Sunday. On Monday I went to school wondering how I was going to go through the whole day as if nothing had happened and wondering",
,"how the teacher and other students would [red text: ?] react toward me. Most of my worries were over that 1st period. The bell rang for the 1st period and quietly we all went to the assigned rooms for Algebra. Our principal taught us that subject. When he came in I could see that he was under some sort of a strain, probably, I thought, as I was. When he got to the desk he looked toward me and said, jokingly. ""How did the basketball game turn out?"" Knowing that our high school team lost to another high school about 20 miles away; that last Friday evening. He asked me a few more questions and I answered with a laugh as best I could. I knew then that he was trying to ease the tension caused by this suddenly erupted chaos. Words cannot express what those few words did to me and others [red text: who] that were in the same [red text: position] boat as I was. The lesson went over in the usual pattern. For at least a month I went through lessons in a semi-strained way.",Education
,"After that life at school was swell for awhile. The reason why I say ""For a while,"" is [red text: that] because in March all the boys like myself ""the Japanese-Canadians"" were called into a counselling room and were told that we were barred from further participation in the high school army cadet corps. In all my school career that was my first and worst heart-breaking experience. There were thirty of us in that room wondering why we were called here. We laughed and joked till the principal came in and conveyed to us the ill-news. You should have seen the expression on their faces; dumbfounded; and looked as if they were all asking the same question ""Why do they have to do this to us?"" Then sadly with bowed heads we silently listened. I couldn't imagine such an order coming from a ministry of Education. The Cadet Corps was one subject in the curriculum I loved very much. I liked that branch so much that I studied all the notes that were given me. We drilled and practised quite a lot. The Battalion was divided into units consisting of the First Aid Corps, Signal Corps, and Officer training Corp. All those wishing to become officers and noncoms",Forced-dispersal;Education;WWII
,"were given tests based on what we had learned so far. Out of the cadets who wrote the exams five corporals were picked, of [red text: whom] which I was one. Later we became candidates for officers training. We studied map reading and other subjects which were essential. The whole course was very interesting. I can say very easily that the rest of the boys like myself liked that very much. The action of barring us from participation in the cadet corps put a brand on us in a way. When the rest of the students would be having corps practise we would be doing other things less interesting. Even if it was supposed to be interesting one [red text: could] cannot expect us to like it. Around about this time studying became less and less important to me and to a lot of others like myself. Long before the Easter holiday I hardly ever took my books home and did not prepare my lessons. The time came one April afternoon when we were told that we were going to Alberta. This was the sixteenth day of April 1942.""",Forced-dispersal;Education;WWII
,"Well Joan, I'll leave it at that for now. I still have a lot of mistakes and everything wrong with the grammar and punctuation and etc. so you'll have to sort of put it together like a puzzle. If you have time, Joan, I'd like very much if you would re-read the 1st and this last part and sort of fix it up; and tell me where I should fill in more and etc. Will you please? I do not intend this to be a story or an essay–I'd like to sort of have it like a long letter to a friend.",Writing
,This last Friday I met Sonny and Mae in Raymond for the first time in 3 years. Gee! but I was sure glad to see them; I mey Ally too. He came to see me yesterday again and we went to a show and talked after till after midnight.,
,"By the way Joan, where do Betty and Margie teach? Do you know their address. I sent a card to May Webb but as yet I have no answer. I heard that Dot Kan is still stationed in Calgary so I may see her. I sure wish I could see you, Betty and Margie soon. We may not recognize each other first but after all 3 years or more is a long time. Remember when Betty went past Calgary? Well, I never got the letter in time to know she was going past Calgary and did not know what time and date she'd pass so I couldn't go to Calgary. Gosh! but I sure wished I knew what date and time.
