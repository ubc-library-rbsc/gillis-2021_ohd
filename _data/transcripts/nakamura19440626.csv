,Dear Joan;,
,"I do not know how to thank you for that swell pin. You do not know how I felt when I touched it and looked at for a long time. That pin alone brought back the memories that I have cherished for so long. It reminded me of Q.H.S. and of the students that were in it and are in it now. It brought me back to the time I shook hands with you on that last day at school. Gosh, but I wish I could live those years over again. I feel like a soldier away on a foreign shore fighting in battles, and thinking the peaceful hours spent before the tragic occurance. Thank you an awful lot Joan, for the pin. I won't forget it.",Homesickness;Education;Forced-dispersal;WWII;Belonging
,"Yipe! hold it Joan, don't talk about the 21st year yet. I feel pretty much like an old man now. On the 21st day I mean birthday I'm going to have a real nice party, something that I can remember. If we are still here at that time I'll send you some of the original cake.",Recreation
