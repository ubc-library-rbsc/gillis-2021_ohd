# About {{site.title}}

The Oral History as Data (OHD) tool is a static website generator that allows users to analyze and publish coded oral history or qualitative interview files.

In addition to our own work transcribing and coding these transcripts, we also wish to thank the students of UBC Professor Laura Ishiguro for their past work to transcribe parts of the letters.
